Welcome to your Lesson 3 - Challenge 2
Now that you have your boilerplate HTML in place, which includes the placeholder text. It is now time to start replacing the placeholder text with the required elements and your own recipe details . We are going to do this over the following challenges.
For this challenge, you are going to add elements to the header and first section
 
In particular, you will add:
The recipe name
The recipe description
The ingredients heading
The list of ingredients
Result
Your result should look similar to the image below

Steps
Remove the recipe name placeholder text and add an <h1> element to the <header> giving it your recipe name
Remove the description placeholder text and add a <p> element to the <header> describing your recipe
Remove the ingredients placeholder text and add a <h2> element to the first <section> . The heading text will be " ingredients"
Remove the list placeholder text and add a <ul> element to the first <section>
The <ul> should contain at least 4 <li> elements listing your recipe ingredients.
