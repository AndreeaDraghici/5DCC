Welcome to Lesson 4 - Challenge 1
In the last two challenges, you added the following to your recipe page:
The recipe name
The recipe description
The ingredients heading
The list of ingredients
The preparation heading
The preparation steps
The copyright text
All that's left in terms of content is the adding of a recipe image to the page.
Your challenge is to do just that.
Result
Your result should look similar to the image below (but with the option using your own image content):

Steps
Within the < header > element remove image the placeholder text and add an <img> element. Set its src attribute value to " https://codeinstitute.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/5DCC/images/Content/oSVKMED.jpg ",
Or you can choose your own image. If you do, please make sure the image has a .png or .jpg file extension name
Give < img > element an alt attribute. The alt attribute should be a short description of the image. Eg. alt="A man drinking tea" , The inclusion of the alt attribute helps screen readers determine content meaning for sight-impaired users
Tips
If you're stuck, the Recipe: Adding an image video will give you everything you need to succeed.
 
Enjoy!
